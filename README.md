# Excel-Sales-and-Finance-Analytics-Project-of-AtliQ-Hardwares-Codebasics

Project Objective:
AtliQ Hardware, a top hardware company specializing in PCs, Printers, Mouse, and Computers worldwide, needs to boost sales and improve net gross margins and Profits.

Now Sales director doesn't just want the reports or Excel files from different regional managers because there are a lot of Excel files and from these reports, potential insights will not come out, so in that case a Data Analyst plays a vital role.

My Goal as a Data Analyst-
This project tackles analyzing a huge dataset with over half a million unorganized sales records, requiring a lot of effort to organize (ETL). The goal is to find important insights to help AtliQ hardware make smart decisions and track key performance indicators (KPIs). The main aim is to make big improvements in how well the company does, especially in net sales and net gross margin.

Task Performed and Insights -
Project 1: Sales Analysis
Made a detailed report on customer performance. Compared to how well they are doing throughout the years, also are they able to achieve the target or not? This helps Atliq to keep an eye on their customer sales also how much discounts they should give to the customers. Also made a market performance vs target report which helps to understand in which country or market AtliQ doing business well and in which country they don't.

Project 2: Financial Analysis
Made detailed Profit and Loss (P&L) reports by Year, Month, and Quarter level. Also made P&L reports for different markets. This helps AtliQ understand how they are doing financially, aiding in making smart choices. Clear and helpful reports were created for communicating with stakeholders. It assisted in comparing AtliQ to other companies and in setting up a plan for budgeting and future spending.

Also made a report to analyze Gross Margin percentage (GM%) by Quarters (sub_zone).

Finally made a detailed report to evaluate different things such as the Top 10 Products that are doing very well, Division Level Report, Top and Bottom 5 Products, and Top 5 countries.
